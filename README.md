# IMG ClickSort
IMG ClickSort is a python based GUI application designed to organize a
large number of images quickly and easily.

## Getting Started
Download the ZIP and extract to a directory. Run the executable.
The terminal will open and the GUI should appear shortly. This may awhile.

## How to Use
Select a folder to manage using the Select Folder button found
at the top-left corner of the window.
```
Note: This program only supports .jpg, .png, and .gif file-types.
```
By default, the output folder will match the input folder shown
in blue. This is a default value and can be changed.

Once an Output Directory is set, create a new folder to sort
images with, or import existing folders.

```
New folders created by the program will NOT appear on your computer until AFTER a file has been assigned to it. 
```

You can now sort images using the available output buttons. When a button
is used all selected images will be moved to the respective folder
inside the output directory.

## Known Issues
* The "Add Hotkey" feature is not yet implemented
* Long folder names do not fit within the button size
* The scrollbar may not correctly align on some machines
* Buttons may remain in a depressed state
